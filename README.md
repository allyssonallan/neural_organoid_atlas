## Code availability
The "notebooks" folder in this repository contains the code used to build an analyse HNOCA.

> **Note :construction:**
> We are currently collecting and uploading all notebooks used in this analysis.
> This note wil disappear as soon as all code has been made available via this page.

The "supplemental_files" folder in this repository contains:
* Snapseed input file containing our celltype hierarchy with associated marker genes
* Model parameters of our scPoli integration model
* scPoli sample embedding of HNOCA

## :construction: Data availability

An pre-release version of containing the public datasets of HNOCA will available here soon.

All data will be released here in due course.
